## 🎯 Purpose

Welcome to **SuiteTools** — *the missing NetSuite tools*.
This monorepo delivers a cohesive suite of NetSuite admin utilities that fill gaps in the native UI, providing faster workflows, richer insights, and an intuitive experience.

It fills in the blind spots with high-value tools that minimize friction including:

- **Script Logs** — Unified execution logs with advanced filtering and export options
- **Concurrency Dashboard** — Precise concurrency metrics with full details (no paging, no coarse buckets)
- **Integration Manager** — Monitor external integrations with an organized, user‑friendly interface

---

## 📐 Architecture

SuiteTools is structured as a modular monorepo with isolated workspaces and shared governance:

- **Frontend** — React + TypeScript SPA powered by Vite and Flowbite‑React
- **Backend** — SuiteScript modules and SDF deployment scripts
- **Shared** — Centralized types, validation schemas, and utilities

This design delivers:

- Unified developer environment with consistent linting, formatting, and build tooling
- Single source of truth for data shapes and validation
- Modular, composable feature development for rapid scaling

> 📘 For detailed design information, see [SuiteTools Architecture Overview](./docs/architecture/architecture.md).

#### ⚙️ `backend/`

- Leverages my [NetSuite-TypeScript-SDF template](https://github.com/mattplant/NetSuite-TypeScript-SDF)
- Contains all backend logic, SuiteScript modules, and deployment scripts for NetSuite
- For additional information, see the [backend README](./backend/README.md)

#### 💻 `frontend/`

- Implements a single‑page application with React, TypeScript, Flowbite‑React components, and Zod schemas
- Organizes components in a hybrid structure:
  - `components/shared/` for UI primitives and inline feedback components
  - `components/features/` for feature‑specific composites and data hooks
  - `layout/` for top‑level layouts (AppLayout, Header)
- Includes build scripts and optimized bundling via Vite
- For additional information, see the [frontend README](./frontend/README.md)

#### 📦 `shared/`

- Houses cross‑workspace TypeScript types, Zod validation schemas, and utility functions
- Enables DRY principles by centralizing logic used by both frontend and backend
- For additional information, see the [shared README](./shared/README.md)
