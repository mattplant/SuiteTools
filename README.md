# SuiteTools Monorepo

Welcome to the **SuiteTools** â€” *the missing NetSuite tools*.

## Summary

SuiteTools is a cohesive suite of NetSuite admin tools that bridge gaps in the native NetSuite UI, delivering faster workflows, richer insights, and an intuitive experience.

SuiteTools fills in the blind spots with high-value tools that minimize friction including:

- Script Logs - Scroll through complete execution logs in one view, with advanced filtering
- Concurrency Dashboard - See precise* concurrency metrics instead of coarse 25% buckets along with full details without paging
- Integration Manager - Configure and monitor external integrations with an organized, user-friendly interface

## Design

Under the hood, SuiteTools is a modular monorepo combining:

- React + TypeScript frontend powered by Vite and Flowbite-React for rapid iteration and consistent styling
- SuiteCloud Development Framework (SDF) backend for seamless deployments
- Shared workspace centralized TypeScript types, Zod validation schemas, and utility functions

This design delivers:

- A unified developer environment with consistent linting, formatting, and build tooling
- One source of truth for data shapes and validation
- Modular, composable feature development for rapid scaling

### backend/

- Leverages my [NetSuite-TypeScript-SDF template](https://github.com/mattplant/NetSuite-TypeScript-SDF)
- Contains all backend logic, SuiteScript modules, and deployment scripts for NetSuite
- For additional information, see the [backend README](backend/README.md)

### frontend/

- Implements a single-page application with React, TypeScript, Flowbite-React components, and Zod schemas
- Organizes components in a hybrid structure:
  - components/shared/ for UI primitives and inline feedback components
  - components/features/ for feature-specific composites and data hooks
  - layout/ for top-level layouts (AppLayout, Header)
- Includes build scripts and optimized bundling via Vite
- For additional information, see the [frontend README](frontend/README.md)

### shared/

- Houses cross-workspace TypeScript types, Zod validation schemas, and utility functions
- Enables DRY principles by centralizing logic used by both frontend and backend, ensuring consistency in data shapes and validations
- For additional information, see the [shared README](shared/README.md)
