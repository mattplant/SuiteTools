This guide is part of the SuiteTools governance set and defines the standards that keep our docs and code predictable, scannable, and contributor‑friendly.

Inside the full guide you’ll find:

- **Style as governance** — not just “nice to have”
- **Tone and voice** — scannable, empathetic docs
- **Naming and formatting** — TypeScript across the suite
- **Documentation habits** — JSDoc, commit messages, changelog entries
- **Rule evolution** — how standards adapt under review

See the full guide here:

This pointer exists for discoverability. Always consult the canonical guide for the authoritative standards.
