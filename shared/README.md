This is the **shared workspace** for the SuiteTools project.

This workspace centralizes reusable logicâ€”such as validation schemas, utility functions, and shared typesâ€”to promote consistency, reduce duplication, and improve maintainability across SuiteTools projects. All modules here are designed to be type-safe, self-contained, and easy to consume from other workspaces.

See the parent directory [README](../README.md) for more information about the SuiteTools project and how to install and use it.

## Naming and folder conventions

> TODO: Thinking of moving to this structure:

- **Schemas:** shared/schemas/<domain>.ts â€” zod schemas by domain.
- **Types:** shared/types/<domain>.ts â€” inferred from schemas; avoid manual duplication.
- **Errors:** shared/errors/<domain>Errors.ts â€” error constructors and codes.
- **Helpers:** shared/utils/<category>/ â€” assertion, result, and small helpers.

---

## Usage

Import the shared modules as needed. We use barrel files to simplify imports, so you can import directly from the `shared` package without needing to specify subfolders.

For example, the script log assert and parse functions:

```ts
import { assertValidScriptLog, parseScriptLog } from 'shared'
```

---

## Validation

Helper functions for schema validation.

- **assert functions**: These throw a `ZodError` if the input is invalid, but return `void` on success. Use these when you want to enforce validation and handle errors via exceptions.
- **parse functions**: These return the typed, validated data if successful, or throw an error if validation fails. Use these when you need the parsed result and are comfortable with exceptions.
- **safeParseâ€“based helpers**: These provide non-throwing, diagnostic results. Instead of throwing, they return an object indicating success or failure, along with error details if applicable. Use these for safer, error-tolerant validation flows.

---

## Design Principles

- **Type Safety First** â€” All modules are written in TypeScript and validated with Zod.
- **Self-Contained Modules** â€” Each utility or schema should be independently usable and testable.
- **Minimal Dependencies** â€” Avoid introducing external dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- **Clear API Surface** â€” Exports should be intentional and documented; use barrel files to simplify imports.
- **DX Matters** â€” All code should be easy to read, test, and onboard into.
