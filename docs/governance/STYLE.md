## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Scope

> **Purpose in Context:** This style guide defines *how* to express content â€” tone, structure, formatting, and naming â€” across all SuiteTools artifacts.
>
> It complements:
>
> - **[SuiteTools Documentation Standards Index](./standards/README.md)** â€” the *what to follow* for structure and governance patterns.
> - **[SuiteTools Documentation as Architecture](../architecture/docs-architecture.md)** â€” the *why* behind our documentation philosophy.
>
> **Out of scope:** Structural requirements (e.g., required sections, badge placement) are defined in the Standards Index.

This guide exists to:

- Ensure **suiteâ€‘wide clarity** in both humanâ€‘readable and machineâ€‘readable artifacts.
- Reduce cognitive load for contributors by making style decisions **predictable**.
- Model **transparent, reproducible governance** â€” every rule here is intentional and documented.

**Scope:** Applies to all documentation, code, and configuration across the monorepo.

**Status:** Living document â€” updated as suiteâ€‘wide conventions evolve.

**Audience:** Maintainers, contributors, and reviewers of any SuiteTools artifact â€” including code, documentation, and configuration.

## Three Pillars of Style

| Pillar | Scope | Role | Link |
|--------|-------|------|------|
| **Documentation as Architecture** | Conceptual | **`Why` we document** â€” guiding _philosophy_ for documentation as governed architecture. | [Philosophy](../architecture/docs-architecture.md) |
| **Standards Index** | Macroâ€‘level | **`What` to follow** â€” enforceable patterns for doc structure, placement, and governance. | [Standards Index](standards/README.md) |
| **Style Guide** | Microâ€‘level | **`How` to express** â€” tone, structure, formatting, and naming conventions for all artifacts. | [Style Guide](STYLE.md) |

## Naming & Terminology

> **Purpose:** Ensure consistent, predictable naming across all SuiteTools artifacts â€” in documentation, code, and config â€” so developers can navigate and understand the suite without cognitive friction.

### Documentation

- Use consistent terminology across all artifacts.
- Define acronyms on first use, then use the acronym thereafter.
- Prefer **plain language** over technical jargon unless the term is widely understood in context.

### Code & Configuration

- **Variables & functions:** `camelCase` â€” e.g., `parseConfig`
- **Classes & types:** `PascalCase` â€” e.g., `ConfigParser`
- **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` â€” e.g., `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`
- Names should be **descriptive, not abbreviated**, unless the abbreviation is widely understood.
- Use **kebab-case** for file and directory names.
- Group related files into directories by feature or domain.

## Documentation Style

See [Documentation Standard](./standards/documentation.md) for structure and governance patterns.

## Code Style

### Code Quickâ€‘Scan Reference

| Aspect               | Rule |
|----------------------|------|
| Language             | TypeScript |
| Formatting & Linting | Prettier, ESLint (SuiteTools config) |
| Commenting           | JSDoc for public APIs, inline for complex logic |

### Language-Specific Rules

- **TypeScript** is the default for all runtime and tooling code.

### Formatting & Linting

- Use **Prettier** for consistent code formatting.
- Use **ESLint** with the shared SuiteTools config for linting.

See [Linting Standard](../governance/standards/linting-standards.md) for details.

### Commenting {#commenting}

- Use **JSDoc** for all public APIs.
- All public APIs must have **JSDoc** with:
  - Description (what it does, not just what it is)
  - Parameters and return types
  - Links to related modules or guides
- Comment complex logic and non-obvious decisions.
- Avoid redundant comments that restate the code.
- Use `// TODO:` for future improvements and `// FIXME:` for known issues.
- Use `@internal` for nonâ€‘public APIs to signal exclusion from generated docs.
- Use `@deprecated` in JSDoc for deprecated APIs, with guidance on alternatives.

### File Naming & Organization

- Use **kebab-case** for file and directory names.
- Group related files into directories by feature or domain.
- Keep files **single-purpose**; avoid large, monolithic files.
- Use `index.ts` for module entry points.

### Config Style

- Use **JSON** for configuration files unless YAML is explicitly required.
- Key ordering should be logical (e.g., alphabetical or grouped by function).
- **Quote rules**:
  - Use double quotes for JSON keys and string values.
  - Use single quotes for JavaScript/TypeScript strings.

## Commit & Changelog Style {#commit-changelog-style}

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages.
- Changelog entries must:
  - Be **humanâ€‘readable**
  - Link to relevant issues or PRs
  - Use consistent tense and voice

> **Reminder:** This guide is a **living document** â€” if you find friction, propose an improvement.
> Stewardship means leaving the suite clearer than you found it.

---

## ðŸ§­ Stewardship Callout

- Follow the structure and tone defined for consistency.
- Regularly review and update documentation to ensure accuracy and relevance.
