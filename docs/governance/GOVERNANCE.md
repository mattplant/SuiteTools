## 🎯 Purpose

SuiteTools governance keeps the monorepo healthy, discoverable, and welcoming — not just today, but for years to come — through a **living system** that evolves alongside the codebase.
Guided by its core steward, it defines the principles, boundaries, and decision‑making patterns that ensure the suite remains **coherent**, **maintainable**, and **reproducible**, while documenting architectural decisions, licensing refinements, and onboarding flows with clarity and context. Although not every note is versioned, key changes that shape developer experience — such as workspace structure, linting rules, or licensing boundaries — are deliberately recorded for future maintainers.

By pairing **developer empathy** with **reproducible processes**, governance ensures that future developers can understand not only the “what,” but the “why” behind every choice.

> **Governance Philosophy**
> Governance adapts, documents, and empowers — always with the next developer in mind.

## 🚫 Current Contribution Status

- External contributions: **Closed**
- Internal maintenance: **Active** — Governance, documentation, and architecture are iterated in real time
- Feedback: **Welcomed** via issue discussions for future planning

> SuiteTools is actively being developed by its core maintainer.
> **External contributions are not being accepted at this time**.

However, the project is being built with future developers in mind—prioritizing onboarding clarity, licensing transparency, and architectural consistency.

## 🧱 Governance Principles

These principles guide every decision, change, and discussion across SuiteTools.
They are suite‑wide commitments — not suggestions — and they evolve alongside the codebase.

- **Design for the Next Developer**
  Every artifact, from code to documentation, should be understandable without tribal knowledge.
  Favor suite‑wide patterns over local exceptions to reduce cognitive load and accelerate onboarding.

- **Empower Through Clarity**
  Use plain language, progressive disclosure, and discoverable artifacts to make governance accessible.
  Anticipate developer needs by making documentation a first‑class part of system design.

- **Adapt with Purpose**
  Evolve governance intentionally, balancing stability with necessary change and aligning processes with long‑term maintainability.

- **Stable by Design: Upstream, Reproducible, Predictable**
  Favor upstream contributions and shared fixes to reduce downstream complexity and duplication.
  Ensure processes are documented, consistent, and traceable so outcomes can be repeated with confidence.
  Enforce clear boundaries and schema‑driven contracts to protect modularity and prevent accidental coupling.

- **Attribution Integrity & Transparent Licensing**
  Maintain clear, consistent credit across all workspaces.
  Balance openness with protection of contributor rights, enabling responsible and sustainable reuse.

## Decision‑Making Patterns

Governance decisions in SuiteTools are made with clarity, maintainability, and developer empathy at their core.

The following patterns guide how decisions are documented, implemented, and communicated across the monorepo:

- **Identify the Scope**
  - **Suite‑wide**: Changes affecting multiple workspaces, shared tooling, governance artifacts, or licensing.
  - **Workspace‑level**: Changes isolated to a single workspace with no cross‑cutting impact.

- **Apply the Principles**
  - **Design for the Next Developer** — ensure clarity for future maintainers.
  - **Empower Through Clarity** — make reasoning discoverable.
  - **Upstream‑First, Predictable & Reproducible** — contribute upstream, keep processes consistent, respect workspace boundaries.
  - **Adapt with Purpose** — evolve intentionally.
  - **Attribution Integrity & Transparent Licensing** — preserve credit and licensing clarity.

- **Document, Reinforce, and Implement with Traceability**
  - Record the reasoning and link to related artifacts (issues, PRs, governance notes).
  - Reflect the decision in documentation, tooling, and configurations to enforce it where possible.
  - Log in changelogs, governance notes, or architectural summaries when appropriate.

- **Reflect and Adapt**
  - Periodically review past decisions to ensure they still align with suite needs.
  - Curate notes for clarity, not volume — evolving alongside the monorepo’s architecture.

## Licensing Clarity and Attribution

SuiteTools applies a consistent dual-license model across the entire monorepo to balance strong copyleft protections with open documentation reuse:

| Component      | License                       | Purpose                                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Source Code    | [GPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE)   | Ensures strong copyleft protections            |
| Documentation  | [CC BY 4.0](LICENSE-DOCS.md)  | Encourages reuse and remixing with attribution |

- **Mixed files** — Governed by the primary content type; split when possible for clarity
- **Third‑party assets** — Governed by their original license; attribution required

If you're referencing SuiteTools in your own work—whether code, documentation, or architectural patterns—please follow the attribution guidelines in [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md) and preserve SPDX headers and NOTICE references where applicable.
