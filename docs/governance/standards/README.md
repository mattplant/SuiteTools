## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Defines the **standards** for SuiteTools documentation structure, style, and governance rules.
Each standard implements the principles in [SuiteTools Documentation as Architecture](../../architecture/docs-architecture.md) as reproducible, enforceable patterns â€” built to be referenced, applied, and kept in sync across the suite.

## ðŸ§± Three Pillars of Style

| Pillar | Scope | Role | Link |
|--------|-------|------|------|
| **Documentation as Architecture** | Conceptual | **`Why` we document** â€” guiding _philosophy_ for documentation as governed architecture. | [Philosophy](../../architecture/docs-architecture.md) |
| **Standards Index** | Macroâ€‘level | **`What` to follow** â€” enforceable patterns for doc structure, placement, and governance. | [Standards Index](../standards/README.md) |
| **Style Guide** | Microâ€‘level | **`How` to express** â€” tone, structure, formatting, and naming conventions for all artifacts. | [Style Guide](../STYLE.md) |
