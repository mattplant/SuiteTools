## üéØ Purpose

This standard defines the required and optional sections for all SuiteTools documentation files.
It ensures every document ‚Äî whether a major public entry point or a small internal guide ‚Äî is well-structured for readability, scannability, and maintainability.

> **Usage Notes:**
>
> - Use the horizontal rule (`---`) before every new H2 to visually separate the new section from the last.

## üóÇÔ∏è Document Sections

A well-structured document body improves readability, scannability, and maintainability.
Use the following sections as a guideline for organizing content.

### Header

See [Documentation Header Standard](documentation-header.md) for the required header structure and templates.

### Introduction

Most people seem to go with **Overview**. I like to have it be **Purpose**, since that drives to the heard, why we have the document.

### Main Content

This is the core of your document, where you present the main information, guidelines, or instructions.
Use clear headings, subheadings, and lists to organize the content logically.

<!-- TODO: Expand with more guidance on structuring main content. -->

### Conclusion

Summarize key points, provide next steps, or offer a call to action if applicable.

### Footer

See [Documentation Footer Standard](documentation-footer.md) for the required footer structure and templates.
