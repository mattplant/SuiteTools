## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

This README is the **entry point** to SuiteTools documentation.
It orients contributors, maintainers, and future developers to the suite‑wide documentation system and how to navigate it.

> **This documentation is not an accessory to the codebase—it’s a foundational layer of SuiteTools: architecture in prose, stewarded for discoverability, transparency, and long‑term maintainability.**

---

## 📖 About This Documentation

SuiteTools documentation is **modular by design**. It spans:

- **Governance** — enforceable standards, licensing, and stewardship practices
- **Architecture** — cross‑cutting patterns, boundaries, and documentation standards
- **Developer Guides** — practical, task‑oriented instructions for setup, customization, and release
- **Workspace Docs** — frontend, backend, and shared module responsibilities

For SuiteTools’ philosophy and modular architecture, see the [Project README](../README.md).
For workspace‑specific details, see the [Frontend](../frontend/README.md), [Backend](../backend/README.md), and [Shared](../shared/README.md).

- [Documentation as Architecture](./architecture/docs-architecture.md) – Living standards for structure, style, and stewardship
- [Error Handling](./architecture/error-handling-architecture.md) – Unified lifecycle for predictable and safe error management
- [Monorepo & Workspace Boundaries](./architecture/monorepo-and-workspace-boundaries.md) – Structure, benefits, and enforcement rules
- [Validation & Type Safety](./architecture/validation.md) – Suite‑wide schema and type strategy

### 🧑‍💻 Developer Guides

Practical, task‑oriented instructions for contributors.

<!-- “how + steps” layer -->
- **Setup**: [Installation](./guides/installation.md), [Uninstall](./guides/uninstall.md), [VS Code](./guides/vscode.md), [Yarn](./guides/yarn.md), [Yarn Workflows](./guides/yarn-workflows.md)

## 📖 Other Documentation

### Project Overview

For a suite‑wide introduction to SuiteTools—its philosophy, modular architecture, and onboarding standards—see the [Project README](../README.md).
It provides a high-level overview of the system’s structure, licensing model, and developer-facing documentation practices.

### Reference Documents

Root‑level files that provide legal and versioning anchors:

- [LICENSE](../LICENSE) – Source code license (GPL‑3.0‑or‑later)
- [LICENSE‑DOCS](../LICENSE-DOCS.md) – Documentation license (CC BY 4.0)
- [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) – Versioned updates across the monorepo

### Workspace Documentation

Each workspace maintains its own documentation, focused on implementation details, customization patterns, and architectural responsibilities:

- [Frontend](../frontend/README.md) – UI components and client‑side logic
- [Backend](../backend/README.md) – NetSuite SDF project and server‑side logic
- [Shared](../shared/README.md) – Types, schemas, and utilities shared across workspaces

These complement the suite‑wide system by surfacing workspace‑specific logic, constraints, and integration points.
