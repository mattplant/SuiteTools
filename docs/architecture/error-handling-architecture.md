## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

This document introduces the **SuiteTools error handling architecture** — the philosophy, lifecycle, and design intent behind our unified error strategy.

Our approach is:

- **Predictable** — every error follows the same lifecycle.
- **Discoverable** — contributors can quickly trace and understand error flows.
- **Consistent** — users and developers see the same patterns across all workspaces.

It is **not** a governance document.
For binding rules and taxonomy definitions, see [Error Handling Standards](../governance/standards/error-handling-standards.md).

This page covers:

- Why SuiteTools standardizes error handling
- The high‑level lifecycle of an error
- How error handling connects to validation, logging, and user experience
- Where to find detailed standards, guides, and references

This lifecycle applies consistently across both SPA and backend contexts, giving developers one mental model for error handling and reducing cognitive load.

## 🛠️ Problem This Solves

Without a unified approach, error handling drifts:

- Silent failures vanish without trace
- Logs are inconsistent and hard to debug
- New developers must reverse‑engineer multiple patterns
- Error logic gets tangled with business logic, making both harder to maintain.

A single lifecycle solves these issues by giving developers one mental model and enforcing **separation of concerns**.

---

## 📐 Why Standardize

Standardization ensures:

- **Every error is normalized, logged, and rethrown — in that order — regardless of origin.**
- Debugging is predictable across the suite.
- UX is consistent for both developers and end‑users.
- Tooling (lint rules, test harnesses) can enforce compliance automatically.

---

## 🌐 Why This Matters

A unified lifecycle means:

- **Better UX** — actionable, safe messages instead of cryptic failures.
- **No hidden failures** — every error path is visible to developers and tooling.
- **Faster onboarding** — new contributors can debug on day one.
- **Cleaner separation of concerns** — error handling stays out of business logic.

---

## 🔄 Error Lifecycle (High‑Level)

SuiteTools uses a **single, predictable lifecycle** for catching, normalizing, and reporting errors across the suite.

Every error in SuiteTools follows the same conceptual flow:

1. **Origin** — error is thrown at a boundary (e.g., validation, integration).
2. **Intercept** — caught and normalized into a `SuiteError`.
3. **Normalize** — enriched with metadata (code, context, severity).
4. **Log** — recorded locally or sent to telemetry.
5. **Surface** — displayed to developers (overlay) or users (fallback).
6. **Propagate** — rethrown or escalated if not fully handled.

### 🔑 The Role of `handleError()`

In SuiteTools, an error begins at its **origin point**, is **caught**, optionally **surfaced to developers** through overlays or adapter‑driven UI, and finally **reported upstream** for logging, monitoring, and triage.

`handleError()` is the single, predictable gateway for all error normalization, logging, and optional surfacing.
Every error — regardless of origin — passes through this gateway to ensure consistent developer experience and predictable behavior across environments.

## 🖼️ Development vs Production Behavior

Error handling behaves differently depending on environment:

| Environment     | Behavior                                                                                                     |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Development** | **Origin → Intercept → Normalize → Log → Surface (Dev) → Propagate** – Full lifecycle with overlays/UI noise |
| **Production**  | **Origin → Intercept → Normalize → Log → Propagate** – Full lifecycle without UI noise                       |

> In development, errors are surfaced loudly for fast debugging.
> In production, they’re logged and rethrown silently to protect user experience.

## 🧩 Relationship to Other Systems

- **Validation & Type Safety** — validation errors map into the taxonomy.
- **Monorepo Boundaries** — errors must not leak across layers without normalization.
- **Build & Release** — CI gates enforce error handling consistency.
- **Governance** — standards define the authoritative taxonomy and rules.

## 🗒️ Stewardship Notes

- Keep this document **narrative and educational** — no binding rules here.
- Update diagrams and lifecycle descriptions as the system evolves.
- Ensure links to standards, guides, and references remain current.
