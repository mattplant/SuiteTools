# SuiteTools

The is the **backend** application for the SuiteTools project.

The backend workspace provides the server-side logic, API endpoints, and data processing capabilities for SuiteTools to connect to NetSuite.

See the parent directory [README](../README.md) for more information about the SuiteTools project and how to install and use it.

## Design Principles

- **Type Safety First** — All modules are written in TypeScript.
- **Backend-Only Logic** — Avoid importing frontend or shared modules.
- **DX Matters** — All code should be easy to read, test, and onboard into.
