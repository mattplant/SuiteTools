# SuiteTools Commit Message Template

Last updated: September 21, 2025

---

Save time by starting your draft commit message as you work instead of scrambling to reconstruct your changes at commit time.

It also helps ensure your final commit message is complete and structured. Commit clarity improves traceability, onboarding, and architectural enforcement.

> **Important:**
> Save this template as `commit-draft.md` in your project directory and update it as you work.

## Best Practices

### Writing Style Tips

- Prefer **descriptive summaries** over clever phrasing
- Use **bullet points that start with verbs** (e.g. Added, Refactored, Documented)
- Avoid vague terms like "fix" or "update" unless scoped clearly

### Commit Structure Guidelines

- Start your commit with a **clear, concise summary** so readers can quickly understand the change
- Use `BREAKING:` sparingly—but clearly—when APIs, types, or behaviors change
- Include the **issue number** if applicable

## Types and Scopes

Use this guide to choose meaningful `type` and `scope` labels for your commit messages. It reinforces clarity, supports tooling, and improves suite-wide traceability.

### Types

Describe the **nature of the change**.

| Type     | Purpose                                              | Example Commit Title                                   |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| feat     | Introduces a new feature or capability               | `#11 feat(validation): infer type from custom schema`  |
| fix      | Corrects a bug or faulty behavior                    | `#12 fix(frontend): fix spacing issue in footer`       |
| docs     | Updates documentation or inline comments             | `#13 docs(shared): add governance documentation`       |
| refactor | Internal restructuring without functional changes    | `#14 refactor(backend): isolate parsing logic issue`   |
| perf     | Performance improvements                             | `#15 perf(backend): optimize data processing loop`     |
| style    | Code style changes that do not affect functionality  | `#16 style(shared): apply formatting rules`            |
| chore    | Routine tasks, tooling updates, dependency changes   | `#17 chore(build): bump eslint to latest version`      |

**Why Types?** They drive changelog automation, semantic versioning, and help reviewers instantly understand the nature of a change.

## Scopes

Specify the **affected area of the suite**.

| Scope      | Description                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| frontend   | UI rendering, user interaction, SuiteScript client-side code  |
| backend    | Server-side SuiteScript, metadata loading, record access      |
| shared     | Common types, utilities, or schema logic used across layers   |
| validation | Zod schemas, custom rules, inference utilities                |
| linting    | ESLint config, rulesets, boundary enforcement logic           |
| build      | Bundling, release tasks, build config and tooling             |
| infra      | CI/CD pipelines, environment setup, deployment configs        |
| docs       | Contributor guides, onboarding materials, markdown updates    |

**Why Scopes?** They pinpoint the affected area of the suite, making it easier to review and trace changes.

## Commit Message Format

This format follows the Copilot-style template and adds GitHub issue numbers for traceability.

```txt
#<issue #> <type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<optional longer description>

<optional footer: related issues, breaking changes, etc.>
```

---

## Track Your Changes

> **Important:**
> Save this template as `commit-draft.md` in your project directory and update it as you work.

Save time by starting your draft commit message **below** as you work instead of scrambling to reconstruct your changes at commit time.

```text
#<issue #> <type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<optional longer description>

<optional footer: related issues, breaking changes, etc.>
```
