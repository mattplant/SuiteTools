SuiteTools documentation is more than reference material‚Äîit‚Äôs a contributor-first resource designed to teach, guide, and inspire.
To ensure these materials remain accessible and remixable across the open source ecosystem, SuiteTools applies a Creative Commons license to all developer-facing documentation, diagrams, and onboarding guides.

This page outlines what that license permits, how to attribute reuse, and which materials it covers.

SuiteTools documentation is designed to empower developers through clear onboarding, architectural guidance, and visual storytelling‚Äîsuch as diagrams, lifecycle charts, contributor flows, and taxonomy references.
