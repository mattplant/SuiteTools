## üéØ Purpose & Scope

SuiteTools takes security seriously. This policy defines how SuiteTools handles security vulnerabilities and how contributors and external parties should report them.

**Scope:** Applies to the `main` branch and latest release. Forks, custom modifications, and unsupported versions are out of scope.

If you discover a vulnerability, please help us protect the community by reporting it responsibly.

---

## üìù Reporting a Vulnerability

- Reports can be sent to **security@[pending-domain]**
  _(This address will be updated once the SuiteTools domain is active. Until then, please use GitHub private advisories as the primary reporting channel.)_
- Or open a **private advisory** via GitHub Security.
  - **Do not** open a public issue for security reports.
- Include:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Potential impact
  - Any suggested fixes or mitigations

---

## üì¶ Supported Versions

We actively maintain:

- The `main` branch
- The latest published release

These versions will receive security updates and coordinated fixes.

### ‚ùå Out of Scope

The following are **not** covered by this security policy:

- Older releases (beyond the latest published release)
- Forks or derivative projects not maintained by the SuiteTools steward
- Custom modifications made outside the official repository
- Archived or deprecated branches

---

## üîÑ Response Process

1. **Acknowledge** your report within a reasonable timeframe.
2. **Investigate** the issue and, if confirmed, **prepare** a fix.
3. **Coordinate** a release and **credit** you (if desired) in the changelog.

---

## ü§ù Responsible Disclosure

Please allow maintainers a reasonable window to investigate, prepare a fix, and publish a release **before public disclosure**.
This ensures the community remains protected while the issue is being resolved.

---

## üß≠ Stewardship Callout

- Changes to this file must be reflected in the changelog.
- Keep cross‚Äëlinks between standards up to date to avoid drift.
