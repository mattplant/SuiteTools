## Contribution Workflow (for maintainers & future reference)

1. **Open an issue first** for significant changes â€” this helps align with suiteâ€‘wide patterns before you start coding.
2. **Fork and branch**
3. **Follow coding standards**
   - TypeScript: strict mode, no implicit `any`
   - Linting must pass
   - Follow the [Commit Message Format](./commit-draft-TEMPLATE.md) for clarity and traceability
4. **Document your change**
   - Update relevant documents
   - Add or update changelog entries in `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Maintain attribution if reusing external code or assets
5. **Submit a pull request**
   - Link to the issue you opened

- Ask questions early in the issue thread â€” we value clarity over assumptions.
